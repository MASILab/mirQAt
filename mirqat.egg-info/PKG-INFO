        The original method implemented here was developed by Riqiang Gao and other members of the MASI lab and is available [here](https://github.com/MASILab/QA_tool). I would encourage users to use that tool as it is much more comprehensive. This package contains only a subset of methods that I used for my own QA-ing tasks. This package contains only these tools, with some modifications (fewer dependencies, list comprehension when possible, `pathlib.Path` instead of `os`, etc.) to be more lean and to create a user-friendly command-line interface to help streamline my own QA-ing.
        
        # Image File Structure
        
        I had used the following file structure, but I tried to modify the code to be more file structure agnostic. Please let me know if you have any issues or submit a PR to improve upon the current implementation.
        
        File structure used:
        
        ```
        . (root)
        ├── 123456789 (subject_ID)
        │   ├── 5555555 (accession_number)
        │   │   ├── 2 (instance)
        │   │   │   ├── 1234.dcm
        │   │   │   ├── 1235.dcm
        │   │   │   ├── 1236.dcm
        │   │   ├── 3 (another instance)
        ```
        
        # Checks
        
        `mirqat --help`
        
        ## Instance number check
        
        `mirqat dcm-instance`
        
        ## Slice distance check
        
        `mirqat dcm-slicedistance`
        
        ## Generate QA report and Check instance number
        
        `mirqat instancen-fold`
        
        ## Filter sessions with few slices but that pass the instance number check
